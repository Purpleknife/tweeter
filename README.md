# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The server-side code (back-end) was provided by Lighthouse Labs. This project is client-side oriented (frond-end).

This project's goals were:
  - Build a Single Page App with jQuery and AJAX.
  - Develop Frond-end skills by using HTML, JS, CSS, SASS, jQuery and AJAX.
  - Getting familiar with Responsive Design.


## Features

- Share your thoughts via a `tweet`. Once submitted, it's immediately visible to the public.
- A `Toggle button` in the navigation bar, next to `Write a new tweet`: Hides or shows the Compose Tweet section for better accessibility.
- A `Scroll up button` at the bottom of the page, to easily navigate through the App.
- A `responsive design` for desktops to ensure a great experience.
